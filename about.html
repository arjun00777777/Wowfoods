        <h2>Welcome to Our Website</h2>
        <p>A food sharing website is a platform that connects individuals, restaurants, and organizations to share excess or unused food with those in need. This concept aims to reduce food waste and alleviate hunger by redistributing surplus food to people who may not have regular access to nutritious meals. Such a website typically facilitates the donation of food items that are still safe to eat but would otherwise go to waste. Users can list available food items, and those in need can browse the listings and request the food they require.</p>
